% function transformationMatrix = create3DTransformationMatrix(roll, pitch, yaw, order, tX, tY, tZ)
% Task: create the 3D transformation matrix corresponding to roll, ptich, yaw angles and a 3D translation
%
% Inputs:
%	- roll: the value of the roll angle in degrees
%	- pitch: the value of the pitch angle in degrees
%	- yaw: the value of the yaw angle in degrees
%	- order: the order of rotation if 1 ZYX, if 0 XYZ
%	- tX = the value of the translation along x in mm
%	- tY = the value of the translation along y in mm
%	- tZ = the value of the translation along z in mm
%
% Output: 
%	-transformationMatrix: the transformation matrix corresponding to  roll, ptich, yaw angles and a 3D translation
